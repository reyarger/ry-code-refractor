# Code Refractor Assignment

## Description 

In this project, I was given a completed html & css file that created a fully functioning webpage, however, lacked clarity within the code. In order to allow others to easily read through the code, I updated the html webpage to include semantic elements that would better define each section of the webpage. Next, I added in compliance code such as alt tags onto the images in order to provide an image description in the case of images failing to load. Finally, I condensed the CSS code to separate the webpage into classes that shared similar style attributes. 

As a result of this project, I was able to reproduce the same webpage, while adding comments on the backend to create an easy to manage code. Hopefully this will allow future collaborators to jump in and update without confusion. 

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.
